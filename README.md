# RIDR

## What is RIDR?
RIDR is a PWA (Progressive Web App) that allows for a user to take full advantage of compaines such as Uber, Lyft, and local taxi companies all from one app.

## Getting Started 
In order to run development for this project, you will need to have Node.js and React installed. Check the resources section below to find hyper-links to the respective web sites. 

### Starting the Server 
First we will need to install all dependencies. CD into the server directory, and run the command `npm -i`. This will look into your package.json file and automatically install all the packages that you will need. 

After running the above step, you can fire up the development server. YOU MUST HAVE NODE AND REACT INSTALLED!! At the server directory, run the command `npm run dev`. This will concurrently run both the front end and back end servers. Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser if you are not automatically kicked there.
